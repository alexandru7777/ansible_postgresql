# ansible_postgresql
Set up a working PostgreSQL database 

This is a basic PostgreSQL database, having a linux user added with sudoers entry and ssh-key, a simple database with a db_user entry and password encrypted with 
ansible vault.

Configurations of postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf might require modifications, depending on the desired outcome.
